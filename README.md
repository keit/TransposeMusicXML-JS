# MusicXML Transpose WebApp

A modern React web application designed for **Jazz learners** and musicians who want to master musical ideas across all keys. This tool specializes in transposing MusicXML files to different keys, with a focus on the widely-recommended **12-key practice method** essential for Jazz improvisation mastery.

Perfect for transposing **short licks, patterns, chord progressions, and musical phrases** into all 12 keys - the gold standard practice technique recommended by Jazz educators worldwide.

## Features

### üé∑ **Jazz Learning & Practice Tools**
- **12-Key Practice Method**: Generate all 12 transpositions in one score - essential for Jazz mastery
- **Circle of Fourths Option**: Practice keys in the theoretical order (C-F-B‚ô≠-E‚ô≠-A‚ô≠-D‚ô≠-G‚ô≠-B-E-A-D-G)
- **Chromatic Order Option**: Systematic semitone progression for methodical practice
- **Single Interval Transposition**: Quick transpose to any specific key (-11 to +11 semitones)
- **Jazz-Friendly**: Perfect for licks, patterns, ii-V-I progressions, and chord voicings

### üéº **Music Display**
- **Interactive Score Rendering**: View transposed music using OpenSheetMusicDisplay (OSMD)
- **Before/After Comparison**: See original and transposed versions side by side
- **Responsive Layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

### üîß **Technical Features**
- **Streaming XML Processing**: Efficiently handles large orchestral scores using SAX parsing
- **Browser-Compatible**: Runs entirely in the browser - no server required
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and modern development experience
- **Real-time Processing**: Fast transposition with immediate visual feedback

## How It Works

### Musical Transposition Logic
- **Chromatic System**: Uses 12-tone equal temperament mapping (C=0 to B=11)
- **Enharmonic Handling**: Prefers sharps over flats for positive transpositions
- **Key Signature Transposition**: Uses circle of fifths progression for key changes
- **Chord Symbol Support**: Transposes both root notes and bass notes in harmony elements

### File Processing
1. **Upload**: Drag & drop or select MusicXML files (.xml, .musicxml)
2. **Parse**: SAX streaming parser processes XML elements on-the-fly
3. **Transpose**: Musical elements (notes, keys, chords) are modified according to the interval
4. **Display**: Rendered using OSMD for interactive music visualization
5. **Download**: Export transposed MusicXML files

## Jazz Learning Guide

### The 12-Key Practice Method

**Why Practice in All 12 Keys?**
- **Muscle Memory**: Build finger patterns across the entire instrument
- **Theory Mastery**: Understand relationships between keys and chord progressions
- **Improvisation Freedom**: Play any lick/pattern in any key during performance
- **Auditory Training**: Develop relative pitch and harmonic awareness

**Perfect for:**
- **Jazz Licks**: Bebop lines, chromatic runs, scale patterns
- **Chord Progressions**: ii-V-I, turnarounds, substitutions
- **Voicings**: Rootless voicings, shell chords, upper structures
- **Rhythmic Patterns**: Comping patterns, syncopated phrases

### Usage Guide

1. **Upload Your Musical Idea**:
   - Create a short MusicXML file with your lick/pattern (use MuseScore, Finale, etc.)
   - Drag & drop the `.xml` or `.musicxml` file onto the upload area

2. **Choose Your Practice Method**:
   - **All 12 Keys** (Recommended): Generates complete practice score
     - **Circle of Fourths**: C‚ÜíF‚ÜíB‚ô≠‚ÜíE‚ô≠‚ÜíA‚ô≠‚ÜíD‚ô≠‚ÜíG‚ô≠‚ÜíB‚ÜíE‚ÜíA‚ÜíD‚ÜíG (Jazz theoretical order)
     - **Chromatic**: C‚ÜíC#‚ÜíD‚ÜíD#‚ÜíE‚ÜíF‚ÜíF#‚ÜíG‚ÜíG#‚ÜíA‚ÜíA#‚ÜíB (Systematic progression)
   - **Single Key**: Quick transpose to one specific key

3. **Generate & Practice**:
   - Click "Transpose" to create your practice score
   - View the complete 12-key score in your browser
   - **Export to PDF** for printing and offline practice

4. **Download for Practice**:
   - PDF: Print for music stand practice
   - MusicXML: Import into your favorite notation software

### Supported Intervals

| +4 | Major 3rd up | E |
| +2 | Major 2nd up | D |
| 0 | No change | C |
| -2 | Major 2nd down | B‚ô≠ |
